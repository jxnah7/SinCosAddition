# SinCosAddition
Computer Science 1 Lab 5

Problem: Suppose that you have been hired as an Undergraduate Research Assistant to help 
Professor Cynthia Garcia. She will need to add the sine of an angle to the cosine of another angle in 
numerous occasions so she asks you to write a program that will get the two angles and calculate 
the addition of the sine of the first one with the cosine of the second one. The angles will be 
expressed in degrees. She needs the result of the addition with three decimal digits.


To solve this problem your program must perform the following tasks:
Declares constant PI:3.141592
Declares variable name that holds text
Declares variables alpha,beta,sina,cosb, and total that hold double precision real numbers
Prompts the user to "Please enter your full name: "
Reads the full name from keyboard and stores it in the corresponding variable
Prompts the user to "Please enter angle alpha: "
Reads the value from the keyboard and stores it in the corresponding variable
Prompts the user to "Please enter angle beta: "
Reads the value from the keyboard and stores it in the corresponding variable
Displays "Thanks ", name
Calculates the sine of alpha and the cosine of beta, and stores the results in the corresponding 
variables
Calculates the total as the addition of the sine and the cosine and stores it in the corresponding 
variable
Formats the output to display the values in fixed format with three decimal digits
Prints a message like the one below:
Using 23 columns displays "sine of alpha: ", using 6 columns displays sina
Using 23 columns displays "+ cosine of beta: " , using 6 columns displays cosb
Using 30 columns displays "-------"
Using 23 columns displays "total: ", using 6 columns displays total

Test and compare your solution with mine for different values of alpha and beta.
Use the following values for both alpha and beta to test your program and ensure it passes the 
tests:
1) 33.0
2) 66.45
3) 87.33
4) 25.76
5) 25.89
